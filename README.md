# Virtual Robotics Playground - Extracted Feature Files

#

# This folder contains all the files needed to run the

# Virtual Robotics Playground feature as a standalone page.

#

# Files:

# home.html - Standalone HTML page (no Django needed, just open in browser)

# robotics_playground.html - Django template version (extends base.html)

# views.py - Django view function

# urls.py - Django URL pattern

# .gitignore - Git ignore rules

#

# Quick Start (standalone, no Django):

# Simply open home.html in any modern browser.

#

# Django Integration:

# 1. Include urls.py in your project's root urlpatterns

# 2. Place robotics_playground.html in your templates directory

# 3. Ensure base.html is available
